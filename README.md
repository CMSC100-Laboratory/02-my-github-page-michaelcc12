<p>Steps in Creating a Github Page</p>
1. Create your GitHub repository. <br>
2. Make it public. <br>
3. Go to the Settings->Pages. <br>
4. Set the branch where your GitHub Pages will be built. <br>
5. Add index.html and its contents. <br>

<p>My Key Takeaways in Doing the Exercise</p>
<p>GitHub has features that let us display static pages to the public through GitHub Pages. Flex layout offers a lot of features which let me have better control on the design and responsiveness of the page. The more I explore its features, the more I realize its power and potential. Lastly, designing web pages is not an easy task since CSS styles can become redundant and may conflict as more of it is added.  </p>
